# StickerApp

An app that allows you to exchange your duplicate album stickers with a missing ones.

## Development features

This app is made with `React.js` & `Redux.js` and it uses `Yarn` as a package manager.

It has custom `ESLint` rules integration so to make it work properly you have to install and configure `ESLint extension` in you editor. It works best in conjunction with `Prettier` -a really cool extension for lazy coders that "prettifies" your code.

In `VSCode` you need to specify ESLint to use Yarn as a package manager by setting `"eslint.packageManager": "yarn"`, and if you are using `Prettier` it's recommended to set `"prettier.eslintIntegration": true`
